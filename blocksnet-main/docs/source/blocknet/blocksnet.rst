===============

**BlocksNet** is an open-source library for generating master plan requirements for urban areas. While achieving the main goal of generating requirements, the library provides more than that:

- Simple yet detailed **city information model** based on city blocks accessibility in graph.
- A **city blocks** generating method.
- Optimized **master plan** generating method provided by **genetic algorithm** according to certain city development **scenario**.
- Fast **provision assessment** method based on normative requirements and linear optimization algorithm.
- Urban territory **parameters balance** based on city development **scenario**.
